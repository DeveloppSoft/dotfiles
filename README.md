# Dotfiles

Install via `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ETeissonniere/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh`.


**Warning**: these files are *heavily* to how I use and interact  with my laptop, I would not recommend running them blindly, you should rather take what you want from them for your own setup, unless you want a laptop you can't use anymore...
